Rust game engine. Yeehaw.

## Requirements
- Rust (https://rustup.rs)
- The Vulkan SDK (https://vulkan.lunarg.com)
- Possibly some packages on Linux, e.g. `libasound2-dev` (alsa)

Should just work with `cargo run`. Tested on macOS (thoroughly), Windows, and Linux (less thoroughly).

When run as a binary, it plays a demo game (see `src/examples/mario`).
